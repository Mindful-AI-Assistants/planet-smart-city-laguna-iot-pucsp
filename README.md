## [From Code to Insight: Data Analysis & Decision Support]():

<br>
# Digital Twin for Residential Energy Monitoring and Optimization - SmartHouse

## 🎯 Project Objective

Develop a solution based on data science and artificial intelligence to **monitor, predict, and optimize electricity consumption in a smart home** (Smart City Laguna). The project simulates sensor data per room and uses machine learning to anticipate consumption patterns and propose savings actions.

<br>

## 📊 Dataset Used

A **simulated** dataset was used, containing daily records with the following variables:

- `Data`: Measurement day
- `KW/H`: Total energy consumption in kWh
- `Quarto1`, `Quarto2`, `Sala`, `Cozinha`, `Piscina`: Number of sensor activations in each room
- `Geração Solar`: Energy generated by solar panels (simulated)

<br>

## 🔍 Business Question

> “How to predict daily energy consumption based on room-by-room behavior and, from this, propose automatic measures for savings and energy efficiency?”

<br>

## 🧪 Methodology and Steps Taken

1. **Data import and visualization**  
Reading the spreadsheet with `pandas` and validating formats.

2. **Preprocessing**  
    - Converting the `Data` column to `datetime` format.  
    - Creating the variable `Dia_ordinal` for modeling.  
    - Calculating average consumption per activation per room.  
    - Simulating solar generation and projecting future consumption.

3. **Predictive Modeling**  
A **Linear Regression** model was trained to estimate consumption (`KW/H`) based on total activations per room. Next-day prediction was also implemented.

4. **Visualizations**  
    - Time series charts with `matplotlib`/`seaborn`.  
    - Ranking of highest-consuming rooms.  
    - Representations of activations by cluster.  
    - Interactive Streamlit dashboard for real-time visualization (optional).

5. **Report Export**  
Automatic generation of PDF reports with relevant data, charts, and forecasts.

<br>


## 📈 Results Obtained

- The regression model showed good ability to predict consumption based on activations.  
- It was identified that **Sala (Living Room)** and **Cozinha (Kitchen)** are the rooms with the greatest impact on consumption.  
- The **Piscina (Pool)**, although with few activations, shows high average consumption per activation, indicating waste; it was removed from the model since the Laguna project is aimed at social housing and does not include pools.  
- Solar generation can significantly offset consumption during peak hours if well managed.

<br>

## ✅ Conclusions and Recommendations

- **Automate shutdowns** in high-use areas such as living room and kitchen to achieve immediate savings.  
- **Schedule pool usage times** to mitigate unjustified consumption peaks.  
- **Leverage solar generation** to balance appliance use during peak generation hours.  
- **Implement alerts** when daily consumption targets are exceeded.

<br>

## 🧾 Deliverables

- Streamlit application with real-time sensor visualization.  
- PDF report with consumption metrics and suggestions.  
- Notebook with the full data pipeline, predictive model, and visual analyses.

<br>

## 👥 Target Audience

This project was developed for an external client interested in **residential energy efficiency** solutions, with potential expansion to condominiums, buildings, and smart cities.

<br>

📌 *This report was prepared based on data science practices applied to residential energy consumption contexts and aims to facilitate decision-making for the end client.*

- **Temporal Evolution**: Allows identification of consumption trends over the days.  
- **Weekly Activations**: Helps visualize patterns by room.  
- **Correlation**: Shows the strength of the relationship between activations and consumption.  
- **Actual vs Predicted Consumption**: Evaluates the quality of the predictive model.  
- **Clustering**: Identifies groups with similar behavior for personalized recommendations.

<br>

## 💡 Recommendations by Profile

| Profile | Main Recommendations |
| :-- | :-- |
| 🔵 Low Consumption | Maintain good practices, encourage solar energy, rewards/gamification |
| 🟡 Balanced Consumption | Automate shutdowns, install presence sensors, comparative reports |
| 🟠 High Consumption | Automate lights/electronics, specific presence sensors, monitor peaks |
| 🔴 High Consumption (Living Room/Kitchen) | Schedule pump outside peak, conscious lighting use, suggest automation and time-of-use tariff |
| 🔴 High Consumption (Kitchen) | Check equipment, control usage times, encourage lighting efficiency |

<br>

## 🧭 Conclusion

The project enables identifying consumption patterns, forecasting future use, and recommending actions for greater energy efficiency, customizing recommendations according to each residence’s usage profile.
